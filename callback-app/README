xml-callback-app -- a small java-servlet that uses long-polling (via POST) to ensure a synchronous communication for clients.
Should work as this:

Request:
Client sends:
<calc>1+1</calc>

Client --> callback-app ..> broker ..> service

callback-app holds request and sends:
<calc>1+1<callback id="123"></calc> (which is proxied by the broker to the service)

Client ++> callback-app --> broker --> service

Service answers:
<callback id="123">2</callback>

Client ++> callback-app <-- broker <-- service

Callback-Serice returns the answer over the still open connection:
Client ++> callback-app
       <--/
	   
With this setup the broker may be used from outside a servlet..
for example a website running ajax-requests on the client side could use the callback-service to get results for certain queries
